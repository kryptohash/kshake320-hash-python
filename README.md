What is Kryptohash?
-------------------

Kryptohash is an experimental new digital currency based on Bitcoin that enables
instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Just like Bitcoin, Kryptohash
uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: 
The managing of transactions and the issuing of new money are carried out 
collectively by the network. Kryptohash Core is the name of open source software
which enables the use of this currency.
